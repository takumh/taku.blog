    <h2><a href="#swimming-brothers"></a>The water was nice</h2>
    <!--time datetime="10-08-2021">Oct 08, 2021</time-->
    <p> 
        The water was nice....
        That is what Chukwu said as we swam. The waves were slapping against our bare skin, gently, 
        unlike the way Mama’s palms would feel against our bottoms that night when we went home late. 
        We looked in the distance, at the hills where Papa said the gods lived and I wondered aloud if the gods liked to swim too. 
        Chukwu laughed but I knew he saw far beyond my joke, far beyond the hills too. I laughed back and sipped sea water, 
        it tasted of salt, and the tears that the forefathers had cried on their way to America,
         tears we would cry when Chukwu disappeared on a boat to America too, the land he had seen beyond the hills. 
         The water would not slap gently against Mama that day as she tried to swim after the boat. It would hit her, 
         and knock the words out of her mouth as she prayed to the hill gods to bring back her son. 
         They would not answer just as they had not answered my forefathers. 
         Chukwu had laughed because he knew the gods did not like to swim. What a shame, because the water was nice.

<h2><a href="#sleepy-sisters"></a>She left without warning</h2>
<p>
    She left without warning, the way twilight suddenly plunges into night. Except she did not plunge, she slipped, 
    almost as if she had wanted to go. Gentle ripples. Frothy bubbles. And there was nothing left afterwards. 
    Nothing except the hypnotic chants that smelt of garlic and pepper as Papa whispered novenas under his breath after supper.
     Nothing except the unsettling hum of the river flowing by, that resonated through the broken windows covered by empty plastic sugar packets. 
     Nothing except a loud quiet in which time lost its meaning, the way December melts into one week and January stretches into nine.
<br>
We have never gone to the river since then. Papa has forbidden us - With threats of whips from the leather belt that hangs next to the kerosene lamp - 
With Promises of future ice cream and cotton candy from the market fair - but most of all - With pleas hidden behind a quivering voice and teary eyes.
<br>
Today is different. The river is not quietly humming. She sings and calls. “Zabe”, she says, the way Mama used to shorten Elizabeth, my name. 
I shake Chipo until she wakes, and together we tiptoe past Papa’s snores to the river. 
When she calls again, I walk into the cold water, listening but not hearing Chipo screaming and Papa howling. I don’t plunge, I slip. Gentle ripples. 
Frothy bubbles. And nothing afterwards. Nothing except Mama’s hand pulling me to the bottom.

<h2><a href="#proud-father"></a>His proud and victorious look</h2>
<p>
    Only the contrived shrill of old ladies were audible in the still morning air. Mama’s cry was the loudest. 
    I wondered why she cried. Was she genuinely mourning for him, or were these tears of relief? 
    The sjambok still hung on the door, that symbol of sovereignty that we all knew and had profound respect for.
     Every time Baba held it; we knew the time for castigation had come. And he would use it with grace and elegance, 
     like it was an extension of his arm. Our bodies, our minds!, had respect for it (even Bhoki, the house dog had  had his dance with the devil, 
     and he knew that when Baba had rested, he too would rest) So I wondered why Mama was crying.
<br>
I still stare at the picture, the one they enlarged and placed next to his white coffin. The colors have faded, like happy memories, 
and only the black and white remain, a sorrowful sepia. I stare at it because of what he wore that day; the Igbo market hat from his trip to Nigeria,
 the kente robe from some past business conference in Accra and the white starched shirt from his vacation in Gabon. I think he knew, 
 that after he died, his five secret wives would come to claim his estate, and divide it, and leave us destitute. 
 Perhaps that is why in the picture, he wore best of all, his proud and victorious  look.

<h2><a href="#ancient-voices"></a>Ancient voices, Silent gods</h2>
<p>
On Sunday after mass, Jonah, Amai and Thomas go to the market to buy provisions for the new school year, brittle khaki covers, 
wrinkled plastic sheets and Jonah’s new shoes. Then they stroll home past the stalls of pungent herbs and spices, 
past the shrill voices of women immersed in salacious gossip covered by righteous rosaries, past the men playing tsoro and drinking musombodhiya 
and past the stall with the brooding masks.
<br>
The mask seller has different faces. For the city men and women who pepper their conversations with English, he smiles softly. 
For the young touts who love to throw stones at his stall, he wears a menacing scowl. For the village folk who think him mad, 
he puts on an indifferent stare. He has another face, of invitation and appraisal reserved for the young boy.
<br>
Today communion tasted like paper, like the seal flap of the tithe envelope that Mama made me lick today before mass, sealing away my dream of new school shoes.
I forget the bitterness, of paper and broken dreams, when I see the mask seller smiling at me, his mouth a cavern bordered by black gums and sparse, nicotine-coated teeth.
“I want to go to the mask stall” I say and Jonah laughs. “The gods are myths brother” he says, stroking his new shoes. “Beware, he is mad and they say he talks to his masks” Mama says.
<br>
The mask seller takes off his stare and puts on a new face, a knowing smile. He hands the boy the Muonde mask and he hesitates then puts it on, wood touching skin, ebony meeting black.
 The mask seller recites incantations, he speaks in ancient voices. And then the mask whispers......

<h2><a href="#love-n-cancer"></a>It smelt like...</h2>
<p>
    It smelt like smoke. The air wore a blue hue and laces of cigarette smoke with marijuana undertones. It was loud. 
    The gramophone, cacophonous laughter and lukewarm conversations were too dense for the dinghy disco. 
    I wanted to leave but you held on to me tightly. Until all I could smell was cocoa butter swirling around your afro. 
    Until all I could hear was your heartbeat answering mine. And we swayed in the disco that smelled like smoke.
<br>
It smelt like smoke. You wore a white veil over it, with soft laces and undertones of unmatched grace. It was noisy. 
The band, faces singing along and voices begging us to kiss again echoed in the chapel. I wanted us to leave but you held onto me tightly. 
Until I could pick the shampoo above the smell of your burnt scalp and straightened hair under the veil.
 Until I kissed you, not out of obligation to the pleading crowd but because I could feel our hearts beating in sync. And we swayed with my head in your hair that smelt like smoke.
<br>
It smelt like smoke. The curtains were stained from all the incense my mother burnt on the windowsill. It was tumultuous.
 The prayers, singing and crying of your mother’s friends from church filled the room. You wanted to leave but I held on to you tightly. 
 Until I realized that there was no longer anything to smell, chemo had taken that. Until I realized that my heart was calling but there was no answer. 
And the curtains swayed as I cried, they smelt like smoke.

<h2><a href="#mother-and-daughter"></a>They stare at the glass...</h2>
<p>
    Revai spits in her palm before she starts braiding a new cornrow. Her hands, toughened by years of pounding peanuts and grinding millet, deftly weave through the thick wild hair. 
    Her rheumatoid knee itches and she stoops down to scratch it. As she does, she catches the smell of cigarettes and his sweat, rising above the smell of paraffin smoke and the sweet potatoes boiling on the stove.
    <br>
    Chipo is in her own world, a world of an unending afternoon. An afternoon where Tino pulls her into the river and closes her eyes until her world is just Everest, 
    Nivea and Old Man Spice, until all she can feel are his fingers tracing galaxies on her skin. Who knew the water could be so warm in the winter? “He is bad for you”, 
    Revai says intruding into Chipo’s fantasy. “Shut up Revai” Chipo says.
    <br>
    The air is silent, except for the girls playing pada outside, laughing carelessly, and the simmering pot on the stove running out of water, hissing menacingly. 
    Revai has been on the same cornrow for minutes. It is once too tight, then too loose, twice too fat and thrice too thin, stubborn and not conforming like Chipo. 
    The girls scream in glee, reminding Revai of a once sweet Chipo. Below, Chipo cradles her belly where Revai’s granddaughter silently grows. 
    She opens her mouth to apologize and tell her about the baby at once, but the stone from the pada hits a window and shattering glass fills the air. 
    They stare at the glass, at broken things that can never be made whole again. They see their reflections.
