                        <p> 
                            Disclaimer: My argument might seem contradictory since I am writing this post in English, which is not my native tongue. 
                            However, let me set the record straight now, that I use English merely for impact and inclusion rather than as a measure of intellect (a thought for another day).
                            So, to jump straight into it, what is it about Africans and “perfect” pronunciations? Simply put, why do African people care so much about nailing pronunciations of foreign words? 
                            I will admit it, I used to be one of those people who would cringe inside when I heard someone pronounce Paris as “Pahris” or “Pehris” instead of “Pahry”.
                            And I know I am not the only one. The sad reality is that many of us idolize perfect pronunciation, almost as proof of one’s intellect, knowledge and “learnedness”. 
                            A lot of people put effort in pronouncing the Italian dish perfectly to the waiter, and glow in self righteousness when it is mentioned that they got it perfectly.
                            Here is the blunt truth (my blunt truth anyway), there is really nothing to be proud of. Why? Because perfect pronunciations do not prove anything about yourself and mostly so because they are hardly reciprocated in their African counterpart terms.
                            Do they and would they put more effort in learning how to pronounce Ouagadougou, the way we do with Paris? (Ouagadougou is the Burkina Faso capital by the way) 
                            Would they pride themselves in learning how to pronounce Injera, mufushwa and waakye the same way we turn our tongues to rubber and jelly trying to pronounce croissant, bruschetta and h’ors d’oeuvres?
                            I don’t think so, and from my recent interactions with non-African people, they don’t care. Many simply give up on pronouncing my name when they see it in its full glory: 
                            Takudzwanashe (yes, that’s it and also yes, don’t feel bad if you’re intimidated by it). And when they try, it is rarely because they really want to learn how to do it or accommodate me, 
                            rather it id to them a fleeting accomplishment that proves what they can do. Next time I meet them, magic q’s, x’s and l’s appear in my name. Truth is, I have stopped expecting them to get it right because 
                            I have also stumbled upon a stone of enlightenment: we pronounce words how we speak them where we are from and there is nothing wrong with that! 
                            These people are not Zimbabwean or Karanga like myself so there really is no expectation (from me personally) for them to know how to say my name the Karanga way.
                            It’s not a sign of defect or ignorance, it is just how their tongue has been moulded by their native language.
                            So dear fellow African, the next time you see croissant, don’t pick up sweat and twist your lips this way and that saying crohsun or crosson or however the “correct” pronunciation is. Say “croysant” or “croysend” or 
                            however best you can pronounce it in your tongue. (Its also fine to know the correct way to say it and do so). And most importantly, don’t cringe or laugh when someone pronounces a word the best way they can, understand them. 
                            (If by any means you laugh, I expect the same energy from you when a non-African person fails to pronounce a word in your native tongue too)
                            Also, if really we make an effort to pronounce Tchaikovsky or Dostoevsky or Michelangelo, perhaps we deserve the same energy back with our own Takudzwanashe’s and Uzoamaka’s and Langelihle’s? Well, that is a thought for another day!

        <!--time datetime="10-08-2021">Oct 08, 2021</time-->
                    <p> 
                        There was a lot of discussion about cultural appropriation this year following the release of Beyonce’s Black is King album (and that Adele picture). 
                        I do not plan on watching the production myself, but I did listen to some of the arguments that were presented for and against the appropriateness of the work. 
                        I am not writing to argue for either side.
                        Being the habitual thinker that I am, the conversation made me think about the place of African artists, creatives and citizens in all of this. 
                        Where are we when people are profiteering from our culture? What are we doing in the process? One could always argue that it is because we lack the financial muscle to do the same but I believe that is not really the whole case. 
                        The fact is Africans are actively engaging in acts of foreign altruism and self sabotage with regards to African culture.
                        It may be the mental legacy of colonialism but many Africans still believe that European or foreign things are superior to African or local things.
                        There is a part of our society that believes that the less traditional/local we appear, the more successful we seem. Most of our artists and creatives have not been different; 
                        they almost always westernize their craft and brands and yes we gobble it up hungrily. Most of us simply do not support local things, be it music, cinema or art.
                        I had an interesting conversation with my former high school principal sometime back. I had been called in, as most of us have been at some point, because my head was not shaved. 
                        I asked him why it was compulsory for me to cut off my hair and he responded that long hair was not “presentable”. I asked him if it was not well-combed and he said it was. “But rules are rules”, he added. 
                        Then I asked him if he would have likewise forced white students to shave off all their hair, if rules were rules. Of course, like adults do in Africa, I was told off in response. I did not mind having my hair cut, 
                        I just didn’t like being forced to when I could keep it “tidy”. I always wondered (and still do) why girls at my school were forced to shave off their natural hair unless they got synthetic braids. Why do we have to cut our natural hair?And why are other black people enforcing this?
                        Of course, the above example is in no way a complete analogy of the bigger picture I try to paint. But I hope it helps us to ask ourselves why we hate our identity so much. Why do we disregard our culture and even suppress it? Why is traditional food embarrassing and low class, 
                        yet foreign food is exotic and high class? Why are we learning chess and scrabble and not tsoro/bao and morabaraba?Our music is heavily influenced by western culture, our movies are not representative of our society (check Netflix people!) and don’t get me started on our fashion and food.
                        We do not always capitalize on the things that are uniquely African in our film and music industry for example. I watched a Kenyan film that featured a wedding on Netflix. There was a segment on Bachelor/Bachelorette parties. I am not Kenyan and maybe this is a thing in Kenya, 
                        but I would have appreciated some sort of reference to Kenyan tradition on marriage (and yes, it would have fit nicely in the storyline and plot of the movie). I also watched a very popular South African Netflix series based around High School students. 
                        In one scene, the mother catches a boy in her daughters room and then just invites him to dinner. Again, I am not South African and obviously really, parenting is different everywhere but I felt like it was a very westernized reaction. I expected some sort of scolding or even beating, considering it was at night too. 
                        Maybe I am overreacting and overly generalizing but aren’t we shortchanging ourselves? Is this a true picture of our society? Our music is mostly no different sadly.
                        Can we complain about appropriation when we ourselves are not exploiting our culture and tradition? Is it fair to pull out the appropriation card on successful projects when we are not willing to incorporate our tradition and culture into our work in the first place? 
                        Honestly, I have no answers, only questions for you to think about.
                        By the way, would you rather post yourself on social media eating sushi with chopsticks or your local dish with bare hands (as most African meals go) ? 
                        Do you know as much of your cultural/traditional holidays/events as much as you know about Halloween and Black Friday? Aren’t you, perhaps, the real appropriator?
                        Whatever your answers are, I hope you are thinking about it!

                    <p> 
                        I know this topic might throw you off a little bit. Well, trigger warning, the following part may throw you off even more. But I implore you to try to read as much as you can before you can make your judgements about my opinion(s).
                        Ok, here goes: I wasn’t (fully) black until 16 August 2020, the day the plane I had boarded from Addis Ababa to Washington DC landed in Dublin for refueling. You might be asking yourselves what I was then. Well obviously I was still black, 
                        but one might say a different kind of black; at least not the blackness that I have come to understand now. 
                        You see, I grew up in a very homogeneous community and in a very black majority country (fun fact: black people are represented on the Zimbabwean flag by two black stripes but other races are not; the white stands only for peace). 
                        For example, all the schools I attended until I graduated High school never had a non-Black student. As a result, I was what you could call a passive–black person because my blackness was never the focal point of my life. Which is why I say I 
                        really became Black on 16 August when I temporarily set foot in Europe.
                        I really have no problem with being black or being called black, maybe not even having to say “I am proud to be black” in the strict sense. 
                        My biggest challenge with this new blackness that I discovered I am, is the fact that it is meant to give me identity yet it seems to strip me of my personal identity at the same time. In primary/elementary school in Zimbabwe, 
                        we would get essays titled “Myself” where you had to write about “Your-SELF”. We would write about our likes – chocolates, ice cream, rice and chicken (a very popular choice); our dislikes, our pets (real and imagined) and even potential careers-doctor, nurse, engineer, pilot and the occasional President. 
                        But no one ever said “I am black“. You could say maybe it was because we grew up in a homogeneous place but to be honest despite that, race was and is never really an issue (at least in the economic and social circles I grew up in).
                        Who we were and What we could be was determined by our individual efforts and attributes. But this new blackness that I found seems to dictate my character even before people know me, and I am supposed to sort-of give some affirmation of my pride in whatever picture the other person has conjured about me in spite of it.
                        Ok, let us step back and look at why logically speaking, I think being proud to be black does not make sense. Race is purely genetic and natural, just like how some people are blondes, some brunettes, some brown-eyed, some blue-eyed, some male, some female etc. I personally believe that ideally, 
                        the same absurdness that would be evoked by someone saying “I am proud to be blonde” or “I am proud to be a boy” should be evoked by someone saying “I am proud to be black”. Why? Because I believe it makes no sense for someone to be proud of things they have and had no control over. 
                        You could just have been born another race just as much as you were born black and just as you were born the medically-assigned gender you were. It would make sense for people to be proud about being good poets, kind people, good athletes or good listeners etc; things that they have control over and directly impact.
                        But of course, we don’t live in an ideal world. No one was ever killed because they were blonde, no one was ever arrested because they had blue eyes and no one was ever told they couldn’t use certain doors because they were redheads ; things which apply to blackness. 
                        The real reason why we are compelled to say we are proud to be black is because people have told us that we should feel otherwise. We are proud to be black (as we should for this next reason) because we sometimes don’t even know how we manage to go through all that we go through and come out sane, human and humane. 
                        Black Pride is therefore a reaction, rather than an action. And while it raises some questions (What about those who are not black, should they then be ashamed?), it is still valid the same way Black lives Matter does not mean that all other lives don’t.
                        My thing though is that this was never my type of black until recently. And simply being here has put me into this complex world of black pride and awareness. But I also feel like it has taken away some part of me, a part of the black I used to own. I am now supposed to react with ire and rage and disgust when someone calls me the N* word. 
                        And while I understand the hate behind that word, the truth is where I am from, it has never meant more than someone listening to too much American Rap music. And to be fair, it is the same way how the K* word (google this if you don’t know it) does not mean anything to the average black American.
                        When people see me, and my blackness, my true story, the “my-SELF” I used to write about in primary school who didn’t have to say I am black, is lost in translation. Black Pride as a reaction then becomes a sort of burden, a battle, a sort-of framework that is required of all black people where I am now. 
                        And people assume I should know because I am black after all, yet honestly, I just recently became black.
                        But the definition of black in America is far more complicated than what we have back in the Bundu. And there are different levels of being black too, a subsystem of racism within the black community (Read about Liberia’s history particularly the Americo-Liberians). I will summon the courage to write about this some other day.
                        So what was the point of this rant? I don’t know. Maybe I wish people could stop to learn about people first before building up all these narratives because “Yes really black people are not all the same”.
                        (some of us are really learning about Juneteenth and Kwanzaa and cookouts along the way) Maybe I wish I could go back to the days where I didn’t have to think about my blackness all the time. Maybe I wish I did not have to feel the need to defend the same blackness all the time, while half the time lost in context because I don’t really know the blackness (or blackness) anymore. 
                        So yeah, maybe whatever opinion you had when you first saw the title was right. But as always I hope this article got you thinking about something.
